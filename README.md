# [Project 1: Neural Network model for visualization recommendation](https://github.com/hexiangl1020/vizml_NNmodel)

* Established a neural network model to recommend the best chart types for visualization and achieved 92% testing accuracy. 
* This is a three-class classification, representing bar, line and scatter. 
* We want to predict the best chart type to visualize each dataset using machine learning model rather than use rule-based system, which has many limitations.

# [Project 2: Covid and Pneumonia X-Ray image classification](https://github.com/hexiangl1020/CoAtNet-covid-19-image-classification)

* Increased testing accuracy by 7% by using CoAtNet model for Covid and pneumonia image classification and solved the problem of overfitting. 
* Lessen the burden of Covid diagnostics for medical system by introducing machine learning models for image classification

# Project 3: Fragile families Case Study
